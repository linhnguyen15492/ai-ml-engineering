    "As you learned in the lectures, eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a very important role in what's called (discrete) dynamical systems. As you might recall, a **discrete dynamical system** describes a system where, as time goes by, the state changes according to some process. When defining this dynamical systems you could represent all the possible states, such as sunny, rainy or cloudy, in a vector called the **state vector**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each discrete dynamical system can be represented by a transition matrix $P$, which indicates, given a particular state, what are the chances or probabilities of moving to each of the other states. This means the element $(2,1)$ of the matrix represents the probability of transitioning from state $1$ to state $2$.\n",
    " \n",
    "Starting with an initial state $X_0$, the transition to the next state $X_1$ is a linear transformation defined by the transition matrix $P$: $X_1=PX_0$. That leads to $X_2=PX_1=P^2X_0$, $X_3=P^3X_0$, and so on. This implies that $X_t=PX_{t-1}$ for $t=0,1,2,3,\\ldots$. In other words, we can keep multiplying by `P` to move from one state to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "One application of discrete dynamical systems is to model browsing web pages. Web pages often contain links to other pages, so the dynamical system would model how a user goes from one page to another by hopping from link to link. For simplicity, assume that the browser is only following links to a new page rather than navigating to an unlinked one. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the state vector $X_t$ will be the probabilities that the browser is on a particular page at time $t$. Navigation from one page to another advances the model from one state vector $X_{t-1}$ to another state vector $X_t$. A linear transformation, defined by a matrix $P$, will have entries $p_{ij}$ with the probabilities that the browser navigates to page $j$ from page $i$. For fixed column $j$, the entries represent a probability distribution describing location of the browser at the next step, given that you are at state $j$. Thus, the entries in each column must add to 1."

    "In order to get the covariance matrix you first need to center the data by subtracting the mean for each variable (column). \n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen in the lectures, the centered data matrix looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = \\begin{bmatrix} (x_{1,1}- \\mu_1) & (x_{1,2}- \\mu_2) & \\ldots & (x_{1,4096}- \\mu_{4096})\\\\\n",
    "                                           (x_{2,1}- \\mu_1) & (x_{2,2}- \\mu_2) & \\ldots & (x_{2,4096}- \\mu_{4096}) \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "From the lectures you know that, for example, the mean of the first variable (pixel) can be found as the mean of all the observations: $\\mu_1 = \\frac{1}{55} \\sum_{i=1}^{55} x_{i,1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following exercise you will implement a function that takes an array of shape $\\mathrm{Num. observations}\\times\\mathrm{Num. variables}$, and returns the centered data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the centering you will need three numpy functions. Click on their names if you want to read the official documentation for each in more detail:\n",
    "- [`np.mean`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html): use this function to compute the mean of each variable, just remember to pass the correct `axis` argument.\n",
    "- [`np.repeat`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.repeat.html#numpy-repeat): This will allow for you to repeat the values of each $\\mu_i$ . \n",
    "- [`np.reshape`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html#numpy-reshape): Use this function to reshape the repeated values into a matrix of shape the same size as your input data. To get the correct matrix after the reshape, remember to use the parameter `order='F'`."

    "In PCA, the first principal component, i.e. the eigenvector associated to the largest eigenvalue, is the one with greatest explained variance. As you might remember from the lectures, the goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality by projecting data in the directions with biggest variability. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, the explained variance of a principal component is the ratio between its associated eigenvalue and the sum of all the eigenvalues. So, for our example, if you want the explained variance of the first principal component you will need to do $\\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{55} \\lambda_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's plot the explained variance of each of the 55 principal components, or eigenvectors. Don't worry about the fact that you only computed 55 eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs, recall that all the remaining eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are zero, and thus won't add enything to the explained variance.\n"
