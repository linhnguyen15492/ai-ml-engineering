One of the great features of the sklearn library is that there is a consistent framework for the workflow needed to use different statistical models.

To do random forest regression, you use the following import:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

To do random forest classification, you use the following import:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

After importing the relevant model, everything proceeds in the same way as for linear and logistic regression as shown in the previous videos.
